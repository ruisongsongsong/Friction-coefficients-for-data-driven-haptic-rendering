The data used for haptic rendering of five materials in our user experiments have been published. 
The MEASUREMENT.mat is the measured data from the LMT Haptic Material Database.
The Transformer.mat is the generated data by our proposed Transformer method.
The AVHR.mat and CAE.mat is the generated data by the audio-visual-aided haptic signal reconstruction (AVHR) and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) method.
